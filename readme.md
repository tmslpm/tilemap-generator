# Tilemap Generator

I developed this tilemap editor for fun and to learn more about certain aspects
of game development. It requires no dependencies. Built with TypeScript/JavaScript
and HTML/CSS, no other frameworks are used. The Canvas API is the core of the editor.

This project is purely for exploration and learning. It is not optimized and would benefit
from a complete rewrite. If I had more time, I would do it, but I have other projects on the go.
